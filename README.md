👋 Hey there fellow human! I'm Akram and I'm a Software Engineer👨‍💻 at NetScout.

On the CS side of things, recently, I've been doing a lot of Kubernetes⎈(my aliases can vouch for me lol), AWS☁️, and Grafana📈 stuff. I enjoy both front-end(like this website lol) as well as back-end(recently java microservices)

I've always been a mountain biker🚵 and soccer⚽ player, but since I moved to Colorado I have also managed to pick up bouldering🧗 and snowboarding🏂 as my latest and greatest sports. 

Cooking👨‍🍳 is also pretty fun, but the fire alarm in my apartment has a certain disdain for me. Even if I bake something for more than a couple minutes it starts to get anxious and whamo🚨 , my whole building knows.
